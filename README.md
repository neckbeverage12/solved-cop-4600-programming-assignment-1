<strong>Learning Objective: </strong>To gain a fuller understanding of process scheduling algorithms by implementing them.

<strong>Development:</strong> Use gcc and the C programming language, on the version of Linux we have set up in our VM.

<strong>Assignment: </strong>Implement the First-Come First-Served, preemptive Shortest Job First, and Round-Robin algorithms as for single processors.

<strong>Input: </strong>Your program will read a file from the current directory called <strong>processes.in</strong>, which will be formatted as follows.  Your program should ignore everything on a line after a <strong>#</strong> mark and ignore additional spaces in input.

processcount 2        # Read 5 processes      runfor 15             # Run for 15 time units      use rr                # Can be fcfs, sjf, or rr      quantum 2             # Time quantum â€“ only if using rr      process name P1 arrival 3 burst 5      process name P2 arrival 0 burst 9      end

Note that the processes do not need to be specified in order of arrival, and do not need to have similar names.

<strong>Output: </strong>Generate a file called <strong>processes.out</strong>, formatted as follows.

2 processes

Using Round-Robin

Quantum 2




Time 0: P2 arrived

Time 0: P2 selected (burst 9)

Time 2: P2 selected (burst 7)      Time 3: P1 arrived

Time 4: P1 selected (burst 5)

Time 6: P2 selected (burst 5)

Time 8: P1 selected (burst 3)

Time 10: P2 selected (burst 3)

Time 12: P1 selected (burst 1)

Time 13: P1 finished

Time 13: P2 selected (burst 1)

Time 14: P2 finished

Time 14: Idle

Finished at time 15




P1 wait 5 turnaround 10

P2 wait 5 turnaround 14

<strong>Clarifications </strong>

This version of Round-Robin <strong>should not</strong> run the scheduler immediately upon the arrival of a new process, unless the CPU is currently idle.

Your program <strong>will not</strong> be given an input that results in an ambiguous decision, such as identical arrival times for Round-Robin or identical burst lengths for SJF; you should avoid generating an error in that case on general principles but it will not appear in either the example inputs or the grading inputs.

<strong>Submitting</strong>

Zip up your code, and upload it to Webcourses.  If you have a single source file then you can simply submit it.  If you have multiple source files, include an appropriate makefile.
